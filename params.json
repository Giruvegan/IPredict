This task has numerous applications such as web page prefetching, product recommendation, weather forecasting and stock market prediction.\r\n\r\nThis frameworks has implementations for the following sequence predictors:\r\n* Compact Prediction Tree (CPT)\r\n* Compact Prediction Tree Plus (CPT+)\r\n* First order Markov Chains (PPM)\r\n* All-k-Order Markov Chains (AKOM)\r\n* Dependency Graph (DG)\r\n* TDAG\r\n* LZ78\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
