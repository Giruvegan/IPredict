{"name":"Ipredict","tagline":"Sequence Prediction Framework","body":"# IPredict, a sequence prediction Framework\r\n\r\n![Sequence Prediction Image](http://s9.postimg.org/oihcg1pj3/context_prefix_suffix_1.png)\r\n\r\nSequence prediction consists in predicting the next item(s) of a sequence of items, given a set of training sequences and a finite alphabet of items (symbols). This task has numerous applications such as web page prefetching, product recommendation, weather forecasting and stock market prediction.\r\n\r\n### This frameworks has implementations for the following sequence predictors:\r\n* Compact Prediction Tree (CPT) [1]\r\n* Compact Prediction Tree Plus (CPT+) [2]\r\n* First order Markov Chains (PPM) [3] 1\r\n* Dependency Graph (DG) [4] 2\r\n* All-k-Order Markov Chains (AKOM) [5] 3\r\n* TDAG [6] 4\r\n* LZ78 [7] 12\r\n\r\n![PPM, DG, and AKOM](http://s8.postimg.org/t1t2ujyid/ppm_dg_akom_1_1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Datasets\r\n\r\nThe following datasets are compatible with this framework and can be used to perform experiments with the proposed sequence prediction models.\r\n\r\n**BMS** is a popular dataset in the field of association rule mining made\r\navailable for KDD CUP 2000. It contains web sessions from an e-commerce\r\nwebsite, encoded as sequences of integers, representing web pages. \r\n%(parse)\r\n\r\n**FIFA** contains web sessions recorded on the 1998 FIFA World Cup Web site and holds over one million web page requests. Originally, the dataset is a set of individual\r\n requests containing metadata (e.g.  client id and time). We converted requests into sequences by grouping requests by users and splitting a sequence if there was a delay of more than an hour between two requests. Our final dataset is a random sample from the original dataset.\r\n \r\n**SIGN** is a dense dataset with long sequences, containing 730 sequences of sign-language utterances transcripted from videos.\r\n\r\n**KOSARAK** is a dataset containing web sessions from a Hungarian news portal available at http://fimi.ua.ac.be/data. It is the largest dataset used in our experimental evaluation.\r\n\r\n**BIBLE** is the religious Christian set of books used in plain text as a flow of sentences. The prediction task consists in predicting the next character in a given sequence of characters. The book is split in sentences where each sentence is a sequence. This dataset is interesting since it has a small alphabet with only 75 distinct characters and it is based on natural language.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n_[1] T. Gueniche, P. Fournier-Viger, V. S.
