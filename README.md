# IPredict, a sequence prediction Framework

Sequence prediction consists in predicting the next item(s) of a sequence of items, given a set of training sequences and a finite alphabet of items (symbols). This task has numerous applications such as web page prefetching, product recommendation, weather forecasting and stock market prediction.

This frameworks has implementations for the following sequence predictors:
* Compact Prediction Tree (CPT)
* Compact Prediction Tree Plus (CPT+)
* First order Markov Chains (PPM)
* All-k-Order Markov Chains (AKOM)
* Dependency Graph (DG)
* TDAG
* LZ78
