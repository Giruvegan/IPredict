==Bugs:
--NewCPTHelper.getSequenceFromId return a sequence starting with -1
--CountTable.update() in the last loop it should be an if...else and not an if...if
+--CountTable.getBestSequence() if two items have the same score, only one will be returned



==Possible Accuracy improvement
add distance measures in the score method
add total support for the item in the score method

==possible Time improvement
--NewCPTHelper.recursiveDivider just before noiseRemover() exit method if (strlen(seq)) == minSize
